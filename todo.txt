types:
    - byte strings: <length in base ten ascii>:<string data>
    - integers: i<integer in base ten ascii>e // note can include "-"
    - lists: l<bencoded values, can be recursive>e
        - for example l4:spam3:egge
        - le is the empty list
    - dictionaries: d<bencoded string><bencoded element>e
        - keys must be strings and appear in sorted order, compared with binary and not "natural" comparison
        - example: d3:cow3:moo4:spam4:eggse represents the dictionary { "cow" => "moo", "spam" => "eggs" }
